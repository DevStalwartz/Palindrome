# Palindrome
Deliverables 

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Using Javascript to come up with the solution for the question above.

We start by creating a function called isPalindrome that takes in a number as a parameter.
We then create a variable called reversedNumber and set it equal to the number that was passed in as a parameter.
we  use for loop to loop through the number and reverse it.

We then check if the number is equal to the reversed number. If it is, we return true. If it is not, we return false.
